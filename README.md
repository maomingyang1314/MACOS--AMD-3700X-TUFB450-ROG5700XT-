# MACOS--AMD-3700X-TUFB450-ROG5700XT-
AMD EFI
testing platform：
  CPU：AMD 3700X
  MotherBoard:ASUS TUF B450 TUF PRO Gaming
  GPU： ASUS STRIX 5700XT
  SSD：WD SN750 500GB  
  MacOS：10.15.7 （EFI）

  After my personal test, the audio that comes with the motherboard can be output from the I/O on the front of the chassis. I haven’t debugged the input yet. The system recognizes it as Intel i5 and the graphics card recognizes normally. I haven’t tested the edited video yet.

Supported the big sur support, audio, start-up no problem. In EFI2 and EFI, it can be used as long as three codes are injected.
