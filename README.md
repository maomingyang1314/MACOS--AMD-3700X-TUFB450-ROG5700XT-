  MacOS：10.15.7 （EFI）
  11.0.1（EFI2） 
EFI3 updated Opencore 0.6.4 to better adapt to Macos 11.0.1.  
EFI2.9.7 update is Opencore 0.6.7 version. Support Big sur.
EFI4 is update,but I have sold my 5700xt,I can't test the EFI4.
After my personal test, the audio that comes with the motherboard can be output from the I/O on the front of the chassis. I haven’t debugged the input yet. The system recognizes it as Intel i5 and the graphics card recognizes normally. I haven’t tested the edited video yet.
  
  If you encounter problems, please leave your valuable comments
Supported the big sur support, audio, start-up no problem. In EFI2 and EFI, it can be used as long as three codes are injected.

 I have update the latest EFI for MacOS,which I packed in .ZIP files.If your AMD card is not 5700XT series .please choise the EFI without 5700XT series.
